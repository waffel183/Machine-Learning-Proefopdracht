# Machine Learning Excercise

A collor classifier that determines if white or black text fits better on a randomly chosen background color. It is possible to train it yourself or you could use the build-in algorithm to train the model

## Software Anaylse 
Unity:
- Pro:
  - Easy to setup
- Con:
  - Hard to find good ML libraries
  - Not a lot of ML examples
  
JS:
- Pro:
  - Lots of resources and examples
  - Easy to deploy and train
- Con:
  - Setup takes a while
  
Python:
- Pro:
  - Lots of libraries and examples
- Con:
  - Don't know the language
  - Needs a lot of setup
  
Conclusion: I picked JS because I already know the language and most of the resources I found were in JS.
